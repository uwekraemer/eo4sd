<h1>S2GM-WMS available now</h1>

<p>S2GM provides scientifically sound and consistent Sentinel-2 composites using a best pixel algorithm (see <a href="https://usermanual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/MosaickingAlgorithms.html" target="_blank">here</a> for full details). One feature of this method is, however, a higher spatial heterogeneity than in single images, also referred to as <em>the salt and pepper effect</em>. We provide a detailed explanation in one of the blog posts <a href="https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/global-image-mosaics/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
    We received several requests for a mosaic product that is smoother in space from users looking for a visually appealing background map. In an attempt to meet these demands, the S2GM team developed a new algorithm based on a temporal mean per spectral band instead of choosing one radiometrically consistent observation. To this end, Sentinel Level 2A products are filtered for clouds and cloud shadows using a) classes of the L2A scene classification and b) an upper and lower percentile filtering of brightness on the temporal input data stack. We call this method ArtCom and generated an example product over central Europe for the second quarter (April â€“ June) 2020.
